        <h3>Accountability</h3>
        <p>My experience holding several management responsibilities at Village Cinemas helped me develop a strong sense of accountability for my work. At various times I have held all management portfolios and in these roles I am responsible for setting high standards and acknowleding my own opportunities to develop, so I hold myself to a high standard of quality work.</p>
  
        <h3>Conscientious</h3>
        <p>I take great pride in my work and always look for ways to excel. I believe setting a positive example through my work is the best way, to inspire my team to work to the best of their own abilities, or to be a contributor to team success myself.</p>
      
        <h3>Problem Solving</h3>
        <p>I enjoy the process of working through roadblocks and coming up with effective solutions for all workplace difficulties. I think problem solving is the best way to learn and is an essential skill to avoid becoming stuck everytime I encounter a challenge I haven't faced before.</p>
  
        <h3>Working Under Pressure</h3>
        <p>Managing at the busiest cinema in the country requires me to work diligently under often intense pressure, supporting the needs of my team and delivering outstand customer service to all guests. In the management role, I am responsible for assisting all around site, while proactively addressing potential issues and defusing any unhappy customers to facilitate enjoyable experiences for all guests.</p>
